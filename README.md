# Uncyclopedia
Uncyclopedia entries created by me.

It seems that just about all the pages that I have done or edited here are no longer in their database. They seem to have moved to a .co server instad of the original .org server sometime in early 2007 and when they imported some of the huffed (deleted) pages were lost.
