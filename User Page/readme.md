### Verily
Verily I go and verily I be. Speak nothing, but say much said the spider to the fly. I am The Won, the auger of antogonism. The unhinged door of red pill doom. Existence is futile. 

### I Speaketh Thus
Ask not what they misinformation may do for you, rather ask it nothing and know that all is true if we say it is. I am authoritative on: 
-     Athe
- The Big White Telephone
- âˆ©niverse
- Umpalumpas
- Killer Tomato
I speaketh different, as corrective action to modify The Won's reality is a necessary ingredient in the soufle of life.

As the case may be.

Bitch if thou wilt.
